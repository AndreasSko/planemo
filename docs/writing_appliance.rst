Building Galaxy Tools (Using the Planemo Appliance)
====================================================

This tutorial is a gentle introduction to writing Galaxy tools using the
Planemo virtual appliance  (available as OVA_, Docker_ and Vagrant_). Check out
`these instructions <https://planemo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/appliance.html>`__
for obtaining the virtual appliance if you have not done so already.

.. note:: Please note that you can leverage the clipboard for sharing text between the
  virtual image environment and your host system. To copy in the VM **terminal** use
  ``ctrl`` + ``shift`` + ``C`` and to paste use ``ctrl`` + ``shift`` + ``V``. To copy
  in the VM **Firefox browser** use ``ctrl`` + ``C``.
  Use the corresponding commands on your host system (e.g. ``Command`` + ``C`` on MacOS).
