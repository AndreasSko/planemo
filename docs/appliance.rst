==================
Virtual Appliance
==================

You can also use planemo as part of a Galaxy tool development virtual
appliance pre-configured with Planemo, Galaxy_, Docker_, a local Tool Shed,
linuxbrew_, and a Codebox_ web-based IDE.

The Galaxy instance that runs in these appliances has been optimized for tool
development - Galaxy will monitor your tool directory for changes and reload
the tools as they are modified, the server will directly log you into Galaxy
as an admin (no need to worry about user management or configuration), and
Galaxy is configured to use a `PostgreSQL
<http://www.postgresql.org/>`_ database back end and execute jobs via `SLURM
<https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/>`_ for robustness. If something goes
and Galaxy needs to be restarted manually - simply run ``restart_galaxy`` from
the command-lincoe.

The virtual appliance is available in two flavors via Docker, Vagrant,
VirtualBox OVA, and as a Google Compute Engine cloud image.

The Docker and Vagrant versions make it trivial to mount an external directory
in the appliance so that one can use there own development tools (such as
editors). The VirtualBox OVA file is a stable way to boot a Planemo virtual
machine on any platform and comes with a pre-configured Xubuntu-based windowed
operate system with graphical editing tools including Atom_.

Docker and Vagrant are tools that can be worked in a traditional development
environment and existing tools and will probably be the preference or power
users whereas the VirtualBox OVA can be thought of more as a complete
environment and may be better for tutorials and workshops where consist user
experience is more important. The Google Compute Engine variant is ideal when
local compute resources are unavailable or insufficient.

Launching the Appliance (Docker)
==================================

There are two variants of the Docker appliance - one is specifically designed
for Kitematic_ a GUI application available for Mac OS X and Windows that
claims to be "the easiest way to start using Docker" and the other is designed
to be used with a command-prompt such as is available under Linux or in Mac OS
X and Windows when using boot2docker_.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kitematic (Server) Edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get started Kitematic, please `download it
<https://kitematic.com/download>`__ if it hasn't been previously installed or
launch it using the application shortcut.

.. image:: images/kitematic_icon.png
   :alt: Screenshot Kitematic Icon

Wait for Kitematic_ to load and search for `planemo/server`.

.. image:: images/kitematic_startup.png
   :alt: Screenshot Kitematic Startup

Once Kitematic_ has downloaded, you can use the search bar at the top to locate `planemo/server`

.. image:: images/kitematic_search.png
   :alt: Screenshot Kitematic Search

There may be several planemo containers discovered  - be sure to pick the
`planemo/server` one for the experience optimized for Kitematic_. Choose to
create this image and it will download.

.. image:: images/kitematic_downloading.png
   :alt: Screenshot Kitematic Downloading

After a minute or so, you should see logs for the running
container appear in the main window.

.. image:: images/kitematic_exec.png
   :alt: Screenshot Kitematic Downloading

Galaxy will now be available by clicking the link in the `Web Preview` section
of the GUI.

Clicking the `Exec` button in the container's tool bar (at the
top, middle of the screen) will launch a root command-prompt. Planemo is
configured for the ``ubuntu`` user - so the first thing you should do is
launch an ``ubuntu`` login session by entering the command ``su - ubuntu``.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Interactive Edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The interactive edition of the planemo docker image is designed for
environments where the ``docker`` command-line tool is available. This can
easily be installed via package managers under Linux - but for Windows and Mac
OS X - boot2docker_ should be installed and launched in order to run these
commands.

The `Docker`_ version of the planemo appliance can be launched using the
following command (which will pull the appliance down from `Docker Hub
<https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/planemo/interactive/>`_).

::

    docker run -p 8010:80 -p 9009:9009 -v `pwd`:/opt/galaxy/tools -i -t planemo/interactive

This command will start Galaxy and various other services and then open a bash
shell with planemo available. This assumes your tools are in your current
working directory (just replace `\`pwd\`` with a path to your tools if this is
not the case).

Docker commands such as ``ps`` and ``kill`` can be used to manage this Docker
container.

This Docker environment will contain your tools and modifications made to them
will be made directly to your filesystem - so they are persistent. Data loaded
into the Galaxy instance (history data for instance) will be lost when the
Docker container is stopped. Check out the `docker-galaxy-stable
<https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable>`_ project for information
on running persistent Galaxy processes in Docker.

Launching the Appliance (Vagrant)
==================================

The latest `Vagrant`_ version of the planemo appliance can be found
`here <https://images.galaxyproject.org/planemo/latest.box>`_. Once you have
installed `Vagrant`_ (`download now <http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads>`_),
the appliance can be enabled by first creating a ``Vagrantfile`` in your tool
directory - the following demonstrates an example of such file.

.. literalinclude:: Vagrantfile
   :language: ruby

This file must literally be named ``Vagrantfile``. Next you will need to
startup the appliance. This is as easy as

::

	vagrant up

Once the virtual server has booted up completely, Galaxy will be available at
`http://localhost:8010 <http://localhost:8010>`__, the Codebox_ IDE will be
available `http://localhost:8010/ide/ <http://localhost:8010/ide/>`__, and the 
local Tool Shed at `http://localhost:9009 <http://localhost:9009>`__.

Launching the Appliance (VirtualBox_ - OVA)
===========================================

The VirtualBox_ OVA variant of the planemo appliance comes preconfigured with
a full windowed development environment (based on Xubuntu). While it doesn't
make mounting files external to the appliance as easy as with the Docker or
Vagrant approach - encompassing the complete environment means it is easier to
setup and provides an identical experience for every developer using it.
Together these make the OVA image ideal for learning such as for tutorials and
workshops.

The latest `VirtualBox`_ version of the planemo appliance can be found `here
<https://images.galaxyproject.org/planemo/latest.ova>`_.

If VirtualBox_ has been installed - the planemo machine can be imported by
download the latest image and double clicking the resulting file. This should
result in VirtualBox being opened to an import screen. Just follow the prompt
and the machine should become available.

Various relevant applications are available under the Xubuntu menu (available
by clicking the Xubuntu mouse icon).

.. image:: images/ova_xubuntu_icon.png
   :alt: Screenshot Kitematic Downloading

The firefox web browser is available right away in the drop down and the Atom_
editor can be found under the `Development` submenu.

Once the virtual server has booted up completely, Galaxy will be available by
opening Firefox in the virtual machine and navigating to `http://localhost
<http://localhost>`__. Likewise the Codebox_ IDE will be available at
`http://localhost/ide/ <http://localhost/ide/>`__ and the  local Tool Shed at
`http://localhost:9009 <http://localhost:9009>`__.

Launching the Appliance (Google Compute Engine)
===============================================

The `GCE`_ version of the appliance is different in that it doesn't run locally
on your computer, but on a remote 'cloud' machine.  Using this variant of the
appliance requires a `Google Cloud Platform <https://cloud.google.com>`_
account with an active payment method.

The first thing you'll want to do is get the gcloud_ administration utility
installed and configured.  Once you've installed gcloud, you can authenticate
and (optionally) set your default project, zone, and region (example below, but
you should choose whatever region and zone are appropriate for your location).
If you set these defaults, you will not have to supply them to all subsequent
commands.

::

    gcloud auth login
    gcloud config set project YOUR-PROJECT-NAME
    gcloud config set compute/region us-central1    (replace us-central1 with another region if desired)
    gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-f    (same for the zone us-central1-f)

Import the image to your account with the following statement.  This will only
need to be done one time, unless you delete the image from your account.

::

    gcloud compute images create planemo-machine --source-uri=http://storage.googleapis.com/galaxyproject_images/planemo_machine.image.tar.gz

To launch the image as a fresh instance, use the following command.  This
command will, upon completion, display an external ip address that you can
navigate to in your web browser.

::

    gcloud compute instances create planemo --machine-type n1-standard-2 --image planemo-machine --tags http-server

If you'd like to SSH in to the instance at this point, it's easy to do with:

::

    gcloud compute ssh planemo


Using the Appliance
====================

If you have started the appliance using one of the above commands, your Galaxy
instance should be running at http://localhost:8010/ and your tools should
appear in the left panel.

A Codebox_ IDE is available at http://localhost:8010/ide/ which should open
right to your tools folder and which lets you open a real terminal. This
terminal lets you run ``planemo``, build a ``Dockerfile``, manage Galaxy, and
more -- right from the web browser.  For wider monitors -
http://localhost:8010/planemo/ will display the Codebox_ IDE and Galaxy side by
side.

Building the Appliance
======================

These applicances are built using the `planemo-machine
<https://github.com/jmchilton/planemo-machine>`_ project which can be used to
build customized recipes of this nature or even appliance for cloud
environments such as Amazon Web Services and Google Compute Engine.
