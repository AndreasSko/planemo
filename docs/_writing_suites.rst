Suites of Tools
==============================

If your desire is to write a tool for a single relatively simple application
or script - this section should be skipped. If you hope to maintain a
collection of related tools - experience suggests you will realize there is a
lot of duplicated XML to do this well. Galaxy tool XML macros_ can help reduce
this duplication.
