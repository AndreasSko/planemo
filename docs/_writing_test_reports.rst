In addition to the in console display of test results as red (failing) or green
(passing), Planemo also creates an HTML report for the test results by default. Many
more test report options are available such ``--test_output_xunit`` which is useful
in certain `continuous integration`_ environments. See ``planemo test --help`` for
more options, as well as the ``test_reports`` `command
<http://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands.html#test-reports-command>`__.
